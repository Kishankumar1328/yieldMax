# ðŸŒ¾ Intelligent Crop Recommendation System

An interactive Streamlit web application designed to provide **crop-specific recommendations** for fertilizers and irrigation methods based on environmental conditions and crop types. This system leverages **LightGBM** for predictions and provides insightful visualizations powered by **Plotly**.

---

## Features

1. **Dynamic Crop Selection**:
   - Choose from **Food Grains**, **Fruits**, or **Vegetables** categories or analyze all crops together.
   - Customizable parameters based on the crop type.

2. **Advanced Recommendation System**:
   - Fertilizer recommendations: Organic, Inorganic, or Mixed.
   - Irrigation recommendations: Drip, Sprinkler, or Flood irrigation.

3. **Interactive Input**:
   - Specify environmental factors like **soil type**, **pH level**, **temperature**, **moisture content**, and more.

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Pie charts for recommendation insights using Plotly.
   - Key environmental metric displays.

5. **Machine Learning**:
   - Models trained with **LightGBM** classifiers.
   - Encoded input features for precision recommendations.
